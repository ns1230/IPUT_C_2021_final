# Address Book Management Program

This program is designed to manage an address book. 
It allows users to perform various operations such as reading address entries from a file, adding new addresses, deleting addresses, sorting the address book, and writing the results to files.

## Program Files

1. `main.c`: The main entry point of the program. It provides a menu-driven interface for interacting with the address book.
2. `address.h`: Header file containing the structure definition for an address and function prototypes for the address book operations.
3. `readAddress.c`: Implementation of the `readAddress` function, which reads address entries from a file and populates the address book.
4. `writeAddress.c`: Implementation of the `writeAddress` function, which writes the address entries to a file.
5. `writeResult.c`: Implementation of the `writeResult` function, which writes the address entries to a result file.
6. `sort.c`: Implementation of the `sort` function, which sorts the address entries in the address book based on a chosen criterion.
7. `add.c`: Implementation of the `add` function, which adds a new address to the address book.
8. `delete.c`: Implementation of the `delete` function, which deletes an address from the address book.
9. `renumbering.c`: Implementation of the `renumbering` function, which updates the address numbers in the address book after deletion.
10. `write.c`: Implementation of the `write` function, which writes the address entries to a specified file.
